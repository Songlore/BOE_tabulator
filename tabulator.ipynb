The period of the agreement is effective upon Board approval through June 30, 2009. AMOUNT OF MONEY AND SOURCE: $25,000.000 - 9905-903009-9188-000000-700000 BACKGROUND/EXPLANATION: The Howard Street Corridor was once one of Baltimore's most vibrant commercial corridors. However, various factors have led to the decline of this area. The corridor's location is important in that it provides a link between the Cultural Center, the Inner Harbor and the downtown area through the emerging Westside district. This pubic improvement strategy has been approved and supported by local and state agencies, as well as property owners and the business community. Under this agreement, The Downtown Partnership, Inc. will fulfill the tasks similar to that of Line Coordinator for the Howard Street Initiative. The Howard Street Initiative is a comprehensive revitalization plan to achieve economic rejuvenation for the Howard Street Corridor of Baltimore City.

AMOUNT OF MONEY AND SOURCE: $2,440.00 - 1001-000000-1950-505215-401774 BACKGROUND/EXPLANATION: The refund represents the proceeds beyond the expenses of receiving, storing, and disposing of the vehicle in question at auction. The refund is in accordance with AM-303-1 and Article 31, Section 97 of the Baltimore City Code (2000). The registered owner and/or lienholder was properly notified that the vehicle was at the Towing Section, and the vehicle remained unclaimed. Therefore, the vehicle was sold at auction and the owner has requested the refund of the excess proceeds from the auction. APPROVED FOR FUNDS BY FINANCE AUDITS REVIEWED AND HAD NO OBJECTION.

The amendment no. 2 will extend the period of the agreement through June 11, 2010. AMOUNT OF MONEY AND SOURCE: No additional funds are requested. BACKGROUND/EXPLANATION: On April 12, 2006, the Board approved the initial agreement for a period of 24 months. On March 21, 2007, the Board approved amendment no. 1 to agreement through April 11, 2009. This amendment no. 2 will extend the agreement through June 11, 2010. The Bureau is requesting amendment no. 2 to provide sufficient time for the completion of the design. All other terms and conditions of the agreement will remain unchanged. During 60% of the design phase of this project, unexpected project delays were encountered over a parcel of land which falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of Recreation and Parks. The parcel of land which was identified in the study phase is needed for the proposed storm water management pond. Two additional alternate locations for the proposed stormwater management pond were evaluated before the Department of Recreation and Parks gave its consensus for use of this parcel. These additional evaluations resulted in significant design delays. The consultant was approved by the Office of Boards and Commissions and the Architects and Engineers Awards Committee.

PB 08820, Fallsway REJECTION - Six bids were received Housing and Service and opened on April 15, 2009. Center After conferring with the Law Dept. and the MWBOO, General Services has determined that a re-bid of the project would be in the best interest of the City. The Board is also requested to approve re-advertisement of the project on May 29, 2009. President: ﬁWe have one item, a protest that remains on our agenda and that is Page 40, Recommendations for Contract, PB 08820, Fallsway Housing and Service Center. I would ask that the protestant and the agencies to come forward.ﬂ Mr. Khalil Zaied, Bureau of General Services: ﬁGood morning.ﬂ Ms. Leslie Winner, Law Department: ﬁGood morning. There is really only one issue here before the Board of Estimates today, and that is, does the Board of Estimates have the right to reject all bids in the best interest of the City. That is the only issue that is here and after careful review of the bids by the Law Department and the Bureau of General Services and Linda1766 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES Davis over there with Contract Administration, the Department of Public Works, joined by the Law Department, believes that the best interest of the City, would require that this entire bid be rejected and re-advertised for re-bid.ﬂ Mr. Zaied: ﬁActually on February 20th, the Bureau of General Services advertised the bids for this project.ﬂ President: ﬁYou don't have to --.ﬂ Mr. Zaied: ﬁWe don't have to, okay.ﬂ Mr. Louis Kozlakowski: ﬁGood morning. Lou Kozlakowski, on behalf of the Michael Group. It is clear that the Board of Estimates has the discretion to reject all bids in the best interest of the City. I am here to persuade you that it is not in the best interest of the City and in fact a very old case, Fuller V. Elderkin, is exactly on point. Where a bidder failed to -- with the City -- failed to bid on certain alternates for the Enoch Pratt Library. That bid was accepted by the City and despite protests, that award as upheld. The reason being quite simply is that, it is not a question of whether or not a bid is irregular. Irregularities can occur in a number of different1767 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES areas. The question for a bid on an irregularity is whether or not it gives someone an advantage. Here, The Michael Group was the low bidder on both alternates A and alternate B. The MBE package showed a 36% participation for MBE's and an 8.9% participation for WBE's. Under either scenario the Michael Group was the low bidder. We have yet to receive a letter from the City explaining exactly what is the problem with the Michael Group, or for that matter what the problem is for any of the other bidders. I looked at the bids myself and the only thing that I can see as a problem for the Michael Group is whether or not it is absolutely required to submit an A and B for the MBE portion of the work. That is the only thing that I can see. I don't know if that is what they are saying is the problem or not. The problem occurs is that the City has a firm price for The Michael Group to do A for $7,200,501.00 and a firm price for the Michael Group for $7,242,501.00 to do Alternate B, and then of course there is a price for MBE's, which is not identified as A or B. But, there are prices for the MBE's to do the work, which is assumed in either price of A or B for The Michael1768 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES Group. The City did not ask for other prices from non-minority subcontractors. That is something that The Michael Group has to work with in any event, for any bidder that bids to The Michael Group. So, the question is, whether or not, and I am assuming that is the defect, whether or not the bid by The Michael Group is non-responsive for not giving a price for MBE's for Alternate B. However, if the City was to award Alternate A, there is no problem with The Michael Group's bid. It fully conforms. It is the low bidder and the City has the discretion to waive irregularities that do not otherwise give The Michael Group an advantage.ﬂ President: ﬁBut you have to understand as well, I mean your arguments are -- would be, I think, appropriate or timely if there had been an award in this case. Then you would come and plead your case for why The Michael Group should be awarded the case, because you feel they were the lowest. But, that is not the case that we have -- that is not the issue that we have before the Board. It is whether the City has the discretion to reject all bids, and to do so, because it is in the City's best interest.1769 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES In your opening you acknowledged that you were attempting to convince us that it was in the City's best interest, but your argument focused on The Michael Group's best interest. I don't think that there has been any argument that its -- to even attempt to persuade us that it is in the City's best interest.ﬂ Mr. Kozlakowski: ﬁMay I make a comment?ﬂ President: ﬁYes.ﬂ Mr. Kozlakowski: ﬁMasterson V. United States 1945. It is the case that everyone cites when they talk about rejection of all bids. And there the Court said, ‚to have a set of bids declared after they are opened and each bidder has learned his competitor's price is a serious matter, and it should not be permitted except for cogent reasons'. And the reason for that is very simple, that on rebid, we now have an auction. If you are going to go ahead in the City's best interest and reject all bids and re-advertise, you should have a cogent reason or a compelling reason or a rational reason, why The Michael Group's bid is non-responsive. Why Whiting and Turner's bid is non- responsive, and why you are not awarding it to the other1770 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES bidders. My guess is, after a certain point when you start rejecting bids and you get to the third, fourth or fifth bidder, the prices get excessively high. That is certainly a rational reason not to award to a bidder that is third, fourth or fifth that is exceptionally high. But the real problem is, no one -- The Michael Group gets a call either Monday or Tuesday about this, so when you say we acted as fast as we could. We didn't get a letter saying our bid is rejected.ﬂ President: ﬁI didn't say, that the timeliness was not. I said that the fact that we are here not about whether or not The Michael Group was the low bidder. This is about whether or the City has the authority to reject all bids. That is the only issue.ﬂ Mr. Kozlakowski: ﬁIt also is a question of first, in the first instance, before you reject all bids, you really should look at, is Michael Group or Whiting and Turner's bid for that matter non-responsive. I would tell you, if you are telling me that the City is just going to go blindly and reject all bids because that is what they think. I think that you are seriously impacting the competitive bid system that the City uses.ﬂ1771 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES City Solicitor: ﬁI would ask that one of the City's representatives just walk us through the thinking on the determination that rejecting all bids and re-advertising is in the City's best interest. I think the protestant has basically asked us to put the particulars of that determination forward and I wish you would do that now.ﬂ Ms. Leslie Winner: ﬁThe City at the time of bid opening, which was April 15th, received six bids. All bids were very carefully reviewed by the Department of Public Works. The first three bidders each had errors with their bids. The Michael Group, which this gentleman is here talking about today, did not submit the MBE/WBE form for Part B. Each bidder was told that they must submit separate MBE and WBE forms. This would make his bid materially defective. In order to maintain a level playing field for all bidders, it was required that this bid be rejected totally, and then the City moved down to the next bid, March-Westin. As we went through each bid, moving from the first bid down to the second and down to the third -- I will let Linda Davis speak to the specifics as we moved down the1772 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES list each one had a defect. Then it became in the City's best interest to rebid this. To make sure at the time of rebid, that the directions in the bid document were clear, which is what has happened, because the City has the right to receive the type of building we want in the way we want it, and not what is bid if that is defective. I will let Linda address those points and Shirley Williams, the head of MWBOO is here, she can address the MBE/WBE.ﬂ Ms. Linda Davis, Contract Administration, DPW: ﬁAs Ms. Winner said, The Michael Group's bid was reviewed and found not to have the MWBOO form for their Alternate B. So, we moved to the next bidder, the March Westin Company, and when we reviewed that package, we found that the March-Westin Company had only submitted a MWBOO package for Alternate B, and they did not submit a second package for their -- I am sorry Alternate A they submitted a package for. But did not submit a package for Alternate B. So, then we again went to the Law Department and asked for an opinion based on that situation. After receiving the opinion, we moved to the third bidder, which was Whiting1773 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES Turner and found that Whiting Turner's Alternate A package was non-compliant, and I will ask Ms. Williams to address the issues here. They were compliant on their Alternate B, but not their Alternate A. As was previously stated, it was clearly stated in the spec book or the bid documents that they had to have a complete Minority and Women's Business Opportunity package for both Alternate A and B.ﬂ Ms. Shirley Williams, Chief, MWBOO: ﬁThe Michael Group submitted an MBE participation packet for Alternate A. We encountered a problem first with Form B. Form B is a kind of summary sheet, one for MBE and one for WBE that gives us the information about the participants, the amount of the contract and other information. If you look at it, The Michael Group forgot to fill it in. There is nothing on the form but the company's name and it is signed by someone.ﬂ President: ﬁDid you need to see it?ﬂ City Solicitor: ﬁNo.ﬂ Ms. Williams: ﬁSecondly, on Form C, which is the Statement of Intent, for each individual participant, we don't have a1774 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES subcontractor percentage. This creates a problem, because on Form B, we don't have a total contract amount. So, we could not compute whether the company was in compliance because we didn't have anything to indicate the total amount of the bid. There is also a form for one contractor, one subcontractor, Abbey, no services are listed, so we could not determine what that firm was doing. For that reason, the packet was not acceptable. For those reasons rather.ﬂ President: ﬁAny questions from the Board?ﬂ City Solicitor: ﬁNo.ﬂ President: ﬁOkay.ﬂ Mr. Kozlakowski: ﬁMay I respond?ﬂ President: ﬁYes.ﬂ City Solicitor: ﬁI am sorry, I didn't hear anything said about Roy Kirby which was the fourth low bidder.ﬂ Ms. Williams: ﬁWe did not go down to number four. On number two, March-Westin they did not have a package for B. On the third bidder Whiting Turner, the Statement of Intent for mechanical contractor was not signed by the prime contractor.1775 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES The Statement of Intent for Superior Painting did not have the contract amount and the percentage of the total contract, and the bidder did not submit the MBE/WBE participation affidavit.ﬂ President: ﬁSo, did you evaluate the fourth one at all?ﬂ Ms. Williams: ﬁWe didn't evaluate the fourth one.ﬂ Ms. Davis: ﬁWe did look at Roy Kirby and Sons and also found a problem in what appeared to be non-compliant with their Alternate B and their -- Alternate A, excuse me, and their Alternate B submittals.ﬂ President: ﬁAnd that is the item that you said would be made more clear in the rebid?ﬂ Ms. Davis: ﬁYes.ﬂ City Solicitor: ﬁSo, you found -- so the City agencies found non-compliance of one kind or another for each of the four apparent low bidders?ﬂ Mr. Zaied: ﬁThat is correct. To add to that also, actually, with the prebid that is scheduled to readvertise on May 29th, and to go ahead and start construction sometime in July, and with the schedule we will rebid at nine months, which1776 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES is going to give us the same time completion schedule as the original bid that we are dealing with for one year.ﬂ City Solicitor: ﬁAnd then just for the record, when you move from the four lowest bidders of the group of six, up to numbers five and six, the price jumps by over a $1,000,000.00?ﬂ Mr. Zaied: ﬁThe first four bidders we looked at, they were between $7,000,000.00 and $8,000,000.00 which is something within the budget that we are dealing with. Looking at the next two, number five and number six, it is closer to $9,000,000.00 and is beyond our budget. At that moment we decided not to go any further with it.ﬂ President: ﬁThank you. Yes.ﬂ Mr. Kozlakowski: ﬁAgain, an irregularity could be as simple as the State of Highway as failing to submit a bid in an orange envelope that is an irregularity at the Maryland State Highway Administration. The question is, whether or not the irregularity gives an advantage. The failure to put percentages on is a simple calculation of looking at the bid documents within the four squares of what was submitted and one can easily compute1777 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES the percentage of MBE participation for The Michael Group as well as the percentage of participation for the WBE. So, the failure to fill out a percentage on a particular form, I would think is not significant, because one can determine that by just simply just looking at the bid documents. In the case of Fuller V. Elderkin, that was exactly the issue that is the low bidder who was awarded the contract did not bid on certain Alternates, and the court agreed with the City, that the failure to bid on Alternate's could not be regarded as material, since they were never finally adopted in the plan. So, the question for the City -- for the Board of Estimates, are you going to go with the short schedule or the long schedule? If you go with the short schedule then The Michael Group is the low bidder and has submitted the documents, because they have all said that we submitted the documents for Schedule A, and there is nothing that would be material in their defects, that they have explained.ﬂ City Solicitor: ﬁThe problem that occurs to me now, if you argue that the failure to submit a complete package of1778 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES information for one of the two Alternates is not material you could end up with the situation that you have here, where some bidders were deficient on A and other were deficient on B, and you are giving the City the opportunity to make a choice which could be arbitrary and be picking among bidders none of whose packages were compliant for both options. You are giving the City a chance to basically mess with the competitive procurement in a way that could be unfair arguably to the bidders and invite challenges. So, you know, I think that one of the real concerns is if we brought your theory and said and well okay, we are just -- pretend that B was not there, we are not concerned with B, we are not going to worry about your defect. We will go ahead with A, even though you did not submit a full package for B, we are inviting a protest and the potential delay that could be involved in that, which is an argument in favor of rejecting all the bids and getting everybody to do it correctly.ﬂ Ms. Winner: ﬁI would like to -- my colleague is quoting Fuller V. Elderkin, which I quote a lot. Anybody who does bidding would quote this case a lot. Fuller V. Elderkin, which was a 19311779 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES case. It has long been well established and settled in Maryland, that a body such as the Board, speaking about the Board here clothed with the statutory authority to award contracts possesses a large measure of discretion. All cases hold that when the awarding of a contract like the one here in question has been committed to a Board in the absence of fraud or collusion, it's decision is final and conclusive and can not be controlled by the Courts. The authorities are uniform in holding that in determining who is the lowest responsible bidder, the municipal authorities have wide discretion and will not be controlled by the Courts except for arbitrary exercise, collusion, or fraud. Therefore, I submit to you again, that the Board has absolute discretion in whether or not to determine that rejection of this bid is in the best interest of the City.ﬂ Mr. Kozlakowski: ﬁThat runs contrary then to any protestor being able to hold up this particular procurement by running to Court. The chances of getting an injunction in Court are about as much as hitting the lottery this weekend, possibly. Because of that case, and other cases as well, you cannot get an1780 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES injunction against a government unless it is fraud, bad faith, type of an argument, which is very difficult to prove in government procurement. So, the real question is, how does the Board want to exercise their discretion. It still comes down to the same question.ﬂ President: ﬁBut even in your argument, you acknowledge that the Board has the discretion and that is the only issue that is before us.ﬂ Mr. Kozlakowski: ﬁYes.ﬂ City Solicitor: ﬁOkay. Are there any other questions?

PB 08820, Fallsway REJECTION - Six bids were received Housing and Service and opened on April 15, 2009. Center After conferring with the Law Dept. and the MWBOO, General Services has determined that a re-bid of the project would be in the best interest of the City. The Board is also requested to approve re-advertisement of the project on May 29, 2009. President: ﬁWe have one item, a protest that remains on our agenda and that is Page 40, Recommendations for Contract, PB 08820, Fallsway Housing and Service Center. I would ask that the protestant and the agencies to come forward.ﬂ Mr. Khalil Zaied, Bureau of General Services: ﬁGood morning.ﬂ Ms. Leslie Winner, Law Department: ﬁGood morning. There is really only one issue here before the Board of Estimates today, and that is, does the Board of Estimates have the right to reject all bids in the best interest of the City. That is the only issue that is here and after careful review of the bids by the Law Department and the Bureau of General Services and Linda1766 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES Davis over there with Contract Administration, the Department of Public Works, joined by the Law Department, believes that the best interest of the City, would require that this entire bid be rejected and re-advertised for re-bid.ﬂ Mr. Zaied: ﬁActually on February 20th, the Bureau of General Services advertised the bids for this project.ﬂ President: ﬁYou don\\'t have to --.ﬂ Mr. Zaied: ﬁWe don\\'t have to, okay.ﬂ Mr. Louis Kozlakowski: ﬁGood morning. Lou Kozlakowski, on behalf of the Michael Group. It is clear that the Board of Estimates has the discretion to reject all bids in the best interest of the City. I am here to persuade you that it is not in the best interest of the City and in fact a very old case, Fuller V. Elderkin, is exactly on point. Where a bidder failed to -- with the City -- failed to bid on certain alternates for the Enoch Pratt Library. That bid was accepted by the City and despite protests, that award as upheld. The reason being quite simply is that, it is not a question of whether or not a bid is irregular. Irregularities can occur in a number of different1767 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES areas. The question for a bid on an irregularity is whether or not it gives someone an advantage. Here, The Michael Group was the low bidder on both alternates A and alternate B. The MBE package showed a 36% participation for MBE\\'s and an 8.9% participation for WBE\\'s. Under either scenario the Michael Group was the low bidder. We have yet to receive a letter from the City explaining exactly what is the problem with the Michael Group, or for that matter what the problem is for any of the other bidders. I looked at the bids myself and the only thing that I can see as a problem for the Michael Group is whether or not it is absolutely required to submit an A and B for the MBE portion of the work. That is the only thing that I can see. I don\\'t know if that is what they are saying is the problem or not. The problem occurs is that the City has a firm price for The Michael Group to do A for $7,200,501.00 and a firm price for the Michael Group for $7,242,501.00 to do Alternate B, and then of course there is a price for MBE\\'s, which is not identified as A or B. But, there are prices for the MBE\\'s to do the work, which is assumed in either price of A or B for The Michael1768 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES Group. The City did not ask for other prices from non-minority subcontractors. That is something that The Michael Group has to work with in any event, for any bidder that bids to The Michael Group. So, the question is, whether or not, and I am assuming that is the defect, whether or not the bid by The Michael Group is non-responsive for not giving a price for MBE\\'s for Alternate B. However, if the City was to award Alternate A, there is no problem with The Michael Group\\'s bid. It fully conforms. It is the low bidder and the City has the discretion to waive irregularities that do not otherwise give The Michael Group an advantage.ﬂ President: ﬁBut you have to understand as well, I mean your arguments are -- would be, I think, appropriate or timely if there had been an award in this case. Then you would come and plead your case for why The Michael Group should be awarded the case, because you feel they were the lowest. But, that is not the case that we have -- that is not the issue that we have before the Board. It is whether the City has the discretion to reject all bids, and to do so, because it is in the City\\'s best interest.1769 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES In your opening you acknowledged that you were attempting to convince us that it was in the City\\'s best interest, but your argument focused on The Michael Group\\'s best interest. I don\\'t think that there has been any argument that its -- to even attempt to persuade us that it is in the City\\'s best interest.ﬂ Mr. Kozlakowski: ﬁMay I make a comment?ﬂ President: ﬁYes.ﬂ Mr. Kozlakowski: ﬁMasterson V. United States 1945. It is the case that everyone cites when they talk about rejection of all bids. And there the Court said, ‚to have a set of bids declared after they are opened and each bidder has learned his competitor\\'s price is a serious matter, and it should not be permitted except for cogent reasons\\'. And the reason for that is very simple, that on rebid, we now have an auction. If you are going to go ahead in the City\\'s best interest and reject all bids and re-advertise, you should have a cogent reason or a compelling reason or a rational reason, why The Michael Group\\'s bid is non-responsive. Why Whiting and Turner\\'s bid is non- responsive, and why you are not awarding it to the other1770 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES bidders. My guess is, after a certain point when you start rejecting bids and you get to the third, fourth or fifth bidder, the prices get excessively high. That is certainly a rational reason not to award to a bidder that is third, fourth or fifth that is exceptionally high. But the real problem is, no one -- The Michael Group gets a call either Monday or Tuesday about this, so when you say we acted as fast as we could. We didn\\'t get a letter saying our bid is rejected.ﬂ President: ﬁI didn\\'t say, that the timeliness was not. I said that the fact that we are here not about whether or not The Michael Group was the low bidder. This is about whether or the City has the authority to reject all bids. That is the only issue.ﬂ Mr. Kozlakowski: ﬁIt also is a question of first, in the first instance, before you reject all bids, you really should look at, is Michael Group or Whiting and Turner\\'s bid for that matter non-responsive. I would tell you, if you are telling me that the City is just going to go blindly and reject all bids because that is what they think. I think that you are seriously impacting the competitive bid system that the City uses.ﬂ1771 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES City Solicitor: ﬁI would ask that one of the City\\'s representatives just walk us through the thinking on the determination that rejecting all bids and re-advertising is in the City\\'s best interest. I think the protestant has basically asked us to put the particulars of that determination forward and I wish you would do that now.ﬂ Ms. Leslie Winner: ﬁThe City at the time of bid opening, which was April 15th, received six bids. All bids were very carefully reviewed by the Department of Public Works. The first three bidders each had errors with their bids. The Michael Group, which this gentleman is here talking about today, did not submit the MBE/WBE form for Part B. Each bidder was told that they must submit separate MBE and WBE forms. This would make his bid materially defective. In order to maintain a level playing field for all bidders, it was required that this bid be rejected totally, and then the City moved down to the next bid, March-Westin. As we went through each bid, moving from the first bid down to the second and down to the third -- I will let Linda Davis speak to the specifics as we moved down the1772 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES list each one had a defect. Then it became in the City\\'s best interest to rebid this. To make sure at the time of rebid, that the directions in the bid document were clear, which is what has happened, because the City has the right to receive the type of building we want in the way we want it, and not what is bid if that is defective. I will let Linda address those points and Shirley Williams, the head of MWBOO is here, she can address the MBE/WBE.ﬂ Ms. Linda Davis, Contract Administration, DPW: ﬁAs Ms. Winner said, The Michael Group\\'s bid was reviewed and found not to have the MWBOO form for their Alternate B. So, we moved to the next bidder, the March Westin Company, and when we reviewed that package, we found that the March-Westin Company had only submitted a MWBOO package for Alternate B, and they did not submit a second package for their -- I am sorry Alternate A they submitted a package for. But did not submit a package for Alternate B. So, then we again went to the Law Department and asked for an opinion based on that situation. After receiving the opinion, we moved to the third bidder, which was Whiting1773 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES Turner and found that Whiting Turner\\'s Alternate A package was non-compliant, and I will ask Ms. Williams to address the issues here. They were compliant on their Alternate B, but not their Alternate A. As was previously stated, it was clearly stated in the spec book or the bid documents that they had to have a complete Minority and Women\\'s Business Opportunity package for both Alternate A and B.ﬂ Ms. Shirley Williams, Chief, MWBOO: ﬁThe Michael Group submitted an MBE participation packet for Alternate A. We encountered a problem first with Form B. Form B is a kind of summary sheet, one for MBE and one for WBE that gives us the information about the participants, the amount of the contract and other information. If you look at it, The Michael Group forgot to fill it in. There is nothing on the form but the company\\'s name and it is signed by someone.ﬂ President: ﬁDid you need to see it?ﬂ City Solicitor: ﬁNo.ﬂ Ms. Williams: ﬁSecondly, on Form C, which is the Statement of Intent, for each individual participant, we don\\'t have a1774 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES subcontractor percentage. This creates a problem, because on Form B, we don\\'t have a total contract amount. So, we could not compute whether the company was in compliance because we didn\\'t have anything to indicate the total amount of the bid. There is also a form for one contractor, one subcontractor, Abbey, no services are listed, so we could not determine what that firm was doing. For that reason, the packet was not acceptable. For those reasons rather.ﬂ President: ﬁAny questions from the Board?ﬂ City Solicitor: ﬁNo.ﬂ President: ﬁOkay.ﬂ Mr. Kozlakowski: ﬁMay I respond?ﬂ President: ﬁYes.ﬂ City Solicitor: ﬁI am sorry, I didn\\'t hear anything said about Roy Kirby which was the fourth low bidder.ﬂ Ms. Williams: ﬁWe did not go down to number four. On number two, March-Westin they did not have a package for B. On the third bidder Whiting Turner, the Statement of Intent for mechanical contractor was not signed by the prime contractor.1775 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES The Statement of Intent for Superior Painting did not have the contract amount and the percentage of the total contract, and the bidder did not submit the MBE/WBE participation affidavit.ﬂ President: ﬁSo, did you evaluate the fourth one at all?ﬂ Ms. Williams: ﬁWe didn\\'t evaluate the fourth one.ﬂ Ms. Davis: ﬁWe did look at Roy Kirby and Sons and also found a problem in what appeared to be non-compliant with their Alternate B and their -- Alternate A, excuse me, and their Alternate B submittals.ﬂ President: ﬁAnd that is the item that you said would be made more clear in the rebid?ﬂ Ms. Davis: ﬁYes.ﬂ City Solicitor: ﬁSo, you found -- so the City agencies found non-compliance of one kind or another for each of the four apparent low bidders?ﬂ Mr. Zaied: ﬁThat is correct. To add to that also, actually, with the prebid that is scheduled to readvertise on May 29th, and to go ahead and start construction sometime in July, and with the schedule we will rebid at nine months, which1776 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES is going to give us the same time completion schedule as the original bid that we are dealing with for one year.ﬂ City Solicitor: ﬁAnd then just for the record, when you move from the four lowest bidders of the group of six, up to numbers five and six, the price jumps by over a $1,000,000.00?ﬂ Mr. Zaied: ﬁThe first four bidders we looked at, they were between $7,000,000.00 and $8,000,000.00 which is something within the budget that we are dealing with. Looking at the next two, number five and number six, it is closer to $9,000,000.00 and is beyond our budget. At that moment we decided not to go any further with it.ﬂ President: ﬁThank you. Yes.ﬂ Mr. Kozlakowski: ﬁAgain, an irregularity could be as simple as the State of Highway as failing to submit a bid in an orange envelope that is an irregularity at the Maryland State Highway Administration. The question is, whether or not the irregularity gives an advantage. The failure to put percentages on is a simple calculation of looking at the bid documents within the four squares of what was submitted and one can easily compute1777 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES the percentage of MBE participation for The Michael Group as well as the percentage of participation for the WBE. So, the failure to fill out a percentage on a particular form, I would think is not significant, because one can determine that by just simply just looking at the bid documents. In the case of Fuller V. Elderkin, that was exactly the issue that is the low bidder who was awarded the contract did not bid on certain Alternates, and the court agreed with the City, that the failure to bid on Alternate\\'s could not be regarded as material, since they were never finally adopted in the plan. So, the question for the City -- for the Board of Estimates, are you going to go with the short schedule or the long schedule? If you go with the short schedule then The Michael Group is the low bidder and has submitted the documents, because they have all said that we submitted the documents for Schedule A, and there is nothing that would be material in their defects, that they have explained.ﬂ City Solicitor: ﬁThe problem that occurs to me now, if you argue that the failure to submit a complete package of1778 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES information for one of the two Alternates is not material you could end up with the situation that you have here, where some bidders were deficient on A and other were deficient on B, and you are giving the City the opportunity to make a choice which could be arbitrary and be picking among bidders none of whose packages were compliant for both options. You are giving the City a chance to basically mess with the competitive procurement in a way that could be unfair arguably to the bidders and invite challenges. So, you know, I think that one of the real concerns is if we brought your theory and said and well okay, we are just -- pretend that B was not there, we are not concerned with B, we are not going to worry about your defect. We will go ahead with A, even though you did not submit a full package for B, we are inviting a protest and the potential delay that could be involved in that, which is an argument in favor of rejecting all the bids and getting everybody to do it correctly.ﬂ Ms. Winner: ﬁI would like to -- my colleague is quoting Fuller V. Elderkin, which I quote a lot. Anybody who does bidding would quote this case a lot. Fuller V. Elderkin, which was a 19311779 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES case. It has long been well established and settled in Maryland, that a body such as the Board, speaking about the Board here clothed with the statutory authority to award contracts possesses a large measure of discretion. All cases hold that when the awarding of a contract like the one here in question has been committed to a Board in the absence of fraud or collusion, it\\'s decision is final and conclusive and can not be controlled by the Courts. The authorities are uniform in holding that in determining who is the lowest responsible bidder, the municipal authorities have wide discretion and will not be controlled by the Courts except for arbitrary exercise, collusion, or fraud. Therefore, I submit to you again, that the Board has absolute discretion in whether or not to determine that rejection of this bid is in the best interest of the City.ﬂ Mr. Kozlakowski: ﬁThat runs contrary then to any protestor being able to hold up this particular procurement by running to Court. The chances of getting an injunction in Court are about as much as hitting the lottery this weekend, possibly. Because of that case, and other cases as well, you cannot get an1780 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES injunction against a government unless it is fraud, bad faith, type of an argument, which is very difficult to prove in government procurement. So, the real question is, how does the Board want to exercise their discretion. It still comes down to the same question.ﬂ President: ﬁBut even in your argument, you acknowledge that the Board has the discretion and that is the only issue that is before us.ﬂ Mr. Kozlakowski: ﬁYes.ﬂ City Solicitor: ﬁOkay. Are there any other questions? I MOVE that we accept the recommendation to reject all bids and to authorize the re-advertising the project on a prompt basis.ﬂ Director of Public Works: ﬁSecond.ﬂ President: ﬁAll those in favor say AYE. All opposed. Motion carries. Thank you very much.ﬂ1781 BOARD OF ESTIMATES 05/20/09 MINUTES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONTRACT AWARDS/REJECTIONS Bureau of Purchases 7.
