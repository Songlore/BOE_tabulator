      "memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Baltimore City Entertainment Group (BCEG).   AMOUNT OF MONEY AND SOURCE:  N/A  BACKGROUND/EXPLANATION:  In November 2008, Maryland voters passed a State of Maryland bill approving the constitutional amendment that authorized a maximum of 15,000 video lottery terminals (VLTs) at a maximum of five locations (facilities).  A facility was authorized in Baltimore City if located within one-half mile of Interstate 95 and Interstate 295, on property owned by the City of Baltimore and not adjacent to or within one-quarter mile of residential property.    The City plans to generate revenue from the VLT facility in the \n",
      "form of a ground rent and various taxes, described below.  The State authorized legislation (Senate Bill 3/2007 Special Session) requires that revenue derived from the VLT facility must be used for a property tax reduction and school construction/renovation.  It is anticipated that the majority of the revenue generated will be pledged to reduce the property tax as recommended in the December 5, 2007 report of Mayor Sheila \n",

      "Development Corporation (BDC) entered into negotiations with the BCEG in which the City's benefit expectations were a major topic. As a result, the BCEG has agreed that the ground rent payments will be computed as 2.99% of Gross Gaming Revenue (money wagered by players less jackpots) and will include a guaranteed minimum payment to the City. The guaranteed minimum payment stabilizes at $15,956,000.00 in year 3. However, the 2.99% City share will allow for additional revenue growth and therefore further City benefit. In addition, the BCEG will make an annual payment equal to the greater of the property tax or $3,200,000.00, increasing annually 3% and stabilizing in year five.  For example, if the property tax in year one is $3,000,000.00, the BCEG will pay the property tax plus an additional $200,000.00.   Under State law, 95% of the revenue generated by the facility must be used for property tax reduction or school construction/renovation.  Although not part of the MOU with the BCEG, the City has calculated its revenue expectations as only \n",
      "the following elements: 1) the 2.99% of gross gaming revenue with a guaranteed minimum payment stabilizing at $15,956,000.00 in year three; 2) the greater of the annual property tax or $3,200,000.00 (increasing annually by 3%); and, 3) other direct taxes generated from the facility including piggyback income taxes, personal property taxes and related hotel taxes.   The BDC hired Christiansen Capital Advisors (CCA) as an independent consultant to review the BCEG's gross revenue \n",
      "projections and help project the total ground rent that would be paid. The CCA provided a high and low estimate for purposes of estimating future ground rent. With the CCA's concurrence, the City chose to utilize the mid-range projections.   Based on the projections, in year one, the VLT facility would generate an estimated $20,800,000.00, which includes the \n",
      "guaranteed minimum rent, percentage rent, property tax, and other direct taxes. By year five, the VLT facility would generate an estimated $25,400,000.00, which includes the guaranteed minimum rent, percentage rent, property tax, and other direct taxes.  \n",

Once operational, the facility will contain 700 full-time jobs, 452 part-time jobs (totaling 1,152 jobs), with average wages per full-time equivalent (FTE) of $41,000.00, and total on-site operational wages and benefits of $38,000,000.00 annually.

In fiscal year 2012, the Baltimore City facility will help to provide $250,000,000.00 to the Maryland Education Trust Fund, of which Baltimore City Public Schools will receive approximately $44,000,000.00 annually. In addition, local impact \n",
      "grants are estimated at $23,500,000.00 and could grow to $28,000,000.00 within five years and stabilize at this amount each year for the life of the facility.
